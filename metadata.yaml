description: |
  Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory date structure 
  store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is similar 
  to memcache but the dataset is non-volatile.
  Redis additionally provides native support for atomically
  manipulating and querying data structures such as lists
  and sets. The dataset is stored entirely in memory and periodically
  flushed to disk.
  This charm supports data replication and provides both the master 
  and the slave services.
